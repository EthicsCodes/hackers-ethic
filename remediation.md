## Remediation

Violations, misapplications, or misappropriations of the [Code of Ethics](./CoE.md) will incur proportionate measures aimed at restoring and maintaining the etiquette of both the individual and the project. These measures will be clearly defined to ensure accountability and allow for independent verification of compliance with the code. Additionally, all remedial decisions are open to [appeal](./appeals.md).

# TODO: outline specific remediation steps and proceedings
