# Code of Ethics

Welcome to our Hacker Code of Ethics. This document delineates the core principles guiding our conduct and decisions. Anchored in respect for individual rights and collaborative integrity, it serves as our ethical compass.

## Hackers' Ethos

We uphold individual sovereignty, underpinned by such values as respect, autonomy, integrity, openness, and pragmatism, as the cornerstone of consensual collaboration.

Consequently, we emphatically oppose the prioritization of ideology over the will of the individual hacker, and are committed to actively seeking, and meticulously crafting tools and processes that robustly defend against any such encroachments into our domain.

Those who embrace this notion will receive a warm welcome.

## Hacker's Bond

I solemnly pledge to uphold this Ethic and its tenets as outlined. I recognize these principles as the bedrock of productive, mutual cooperation and as fundamental to our collective success. Further, I dedicate myself to the advancement of the project and the well-being of its denizens, and to that end, will enact these values in all my dealings here, to the best of my ability.

### Tenets

1. **Purpose** —
   Directly advance the project's [technical goals][goals] in alignment with the [project owner(s)'][owners] vision through every action and decision.

2. **Simplicity** —
   Make everything as simple as possible, without compromise.

3. **Flexibility** —
   Be open, collaborate, experiment, innovate, adapt, pivot, profit, and repeat...

4. **Accountability** —
   Take ownership of your actions and their impact on the project.

5. **Analysis** —
   Courteously scrutinize change requests for quality, conciseness, and relevance.
