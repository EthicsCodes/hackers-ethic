# Contributor Code of Ethics

## Requisite of Participation

I commit to uphold the following tenets, for the benefit of the project, and the detriment of none.

## Tenets

1. Project Goals First
Every action and decision must directly advance the project's goals.
2. Evaluate on Merit
Contributions are assessed solely on quality and relevance.
3. Transparent Processes
All decision-making processes must be clear and open to all contributors.
4. Professional Conduct
In acknowledgment of our equal standing as contributors, disregard personal differences and allow room for individual critique while remaining mutually respectful at all times.
5. Accountability
Contributors are responsible for their actions in official spaces, and their impact on the project.
