# Code of Ethics

Welcome to our Hacker Code of Ethics, outlining the core values guiding our conduct and decisions, anchored in respect for individual rights and collaborative integrity. This is a living document, open to updates that align with these ethical principles and enhance our common understanding.

## Hackers' Ethos

As independent operators, individuals commit to respect, integrity, openness, and pragmatism, aligning their efforts with clearly defined project goals.

Transparent processes are established to uphold these principles, ensuring personal autonomy and advancing our collective mission.

We invite those who share these values to contribute to a space governed by clear ethical standards and mutual respect.

## Hacker's Bond

I pledge to uphold this Ethic, committing to think freely and recognizing these tenets and Ethos as essential for productive cooperation and collective success. I dedicate myself to advancing the project, the well-being of its participants, and my own skills and knowledge, enacting these values in all my interactions.
