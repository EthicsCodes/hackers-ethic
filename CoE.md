# Code of Ethics

## Hackers' Ethos

We uphold individual sovereignty, underpinned by such values as respect, autonomy, integrity, openness, and pragmatism, as the cornerstone of consensual collaboration.

Moreover, we emphatically oppose incompatible ideologies that elevate mobs or demagogues above individual hackers, and we deliberately choose tools and processes which aid in resisting their incursion into our domain.

Those who embrace these principles will receive a warm welcome.

## Hacker's Accord

I pledge to steadfastly uphold the tenets outlined, dedicating myself to the advancement of the project and the well-being of its denizens. I accept them as fundamentally essential to productive, mutual cooperation. Therefore, I will embody these values in all my dealings, and to the best of my ability.

## Tenets

1. **Purpose** —
   Every action and decision must aim to directly advance the project's [technical goals][goals], aligning with the vision set forth by the [project owner(s)][owners].

2. **Analysis** —
   Change requests are courteously scrutinized for quality, conciseness, and relevance.

3. **Transparency** —
   All decision-making processes are documented and swiftly made perpetually accessible to ensure efficacy.

4. **Professionalism** —
   Consider _all_ hackers as equals, exhibit decorum, and cultivate self-discipline.

5. **Accountability** —
   Take ownership of your actions and their impact on the project.

6. **Subsidiarity** —
   Delegate decisions locally where appropriate to promote efficient autonomy.
