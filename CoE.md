# Code of Ethics

Welcome to our Hacker Code of Ethics. This document delineates the core principles guiding our conduct and decisions. Anchored in respect for individual rights and collaborative integrity, it serves as our ethical compass.

## Hackers' Ethos

We uphold individual sovereignty, underpinned by such values as respect, autonomy, integrity, openness, and pragmatism, as the cornerstone of consensual collaboration.

Moreover, we emphatically oppose incompatible ideologies that elevate mobs or demagogues above individual hackers, and we deliberately choose tools and processes which aid in resisting their incursion into our domain.

Those who embrace this notion will receive a warm welcome.

## Hacker's Bond

I pledge to steadfastly uphold this Ethic and its tenets as outlined, dedicating myself to the advancement of the project and the well-being of its denizens. I accept them as fundamentally essential to productive, mutual cooperation. Therefore, I will embody these values in all my dealings, and to the best of my ability.

### Tenets

   Be open, collaborate, experiment, innovate, adapt, pivot, profit, and repeat...
