# Code of Ethics

Welcome to our Hacker Code of Ethics, outlining the core values guiding our conduct and decisions; placing individual rights and the continuity of collaboration at the foundation.

This framework is amenable to revisions which align with its aims and enhance our common understanding.

## Hackers' Ethos

We resolve to guide our collaborative efforts and individual contributions with respect, autonomy, integrity, and pragmatism.

Meticulously crafting processes and tools that adhere to our ethical standards, we safeguard our project in goodwill through innovation.

We welcome all who embrace this vision, uniting in our pursuit of joint progress and individual freedom.

## Hacker's Bond

I pledge to uphold this Ethic, committing to think freely and recognizing these tenets and Ethos as essential for productive cooperation and collective success.
