# Hackers' Ethic

Welcome to our Code of Ethics, outlining the core values guiding our conduct and decisions; placing individual rights and the continuity of collaboration at the foundation.

This framework is amenable to revisions which align with its aims and enhance our common understanding.

## Hackers' Ethos

Guided by respect, autonomy, integrity, curiosity, and pragmatism, the status quo is challenged to solve real-world problems.

With the courage to see it through, processes and tools are forged to meet ethical standards, ensuring the project's success through innovation.

All who embrace this vision are welcomed, uniting in the pursuit of joint progress and individual freedom.

## Hacker's Bond

I pledge to uphold this Ethic, recognizing these Tenets and Ethos as essential for productive cooperation and collective success.

Committed to thinking freely while ensuring the same for others; I dedicate myself to advancing the project, the well-being of its participants, and my own skills and knowledge.

With my word as my Bond, I enact this Ethic in all my dealings here.
