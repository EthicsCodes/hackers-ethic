# Introduction

This section lists the official project spaces governed by these codes. While we cannot ethically enforce these standards beyond the [defined scope](/CoE.md#scope), we encourage all unofficial spaces to at least loosely adhere to our Ethic for the sake of continuity.

If there are discrepancies here between branches, treat the default branch's contents as canonical, unless specified otherwise by the [project owner(s)'](./CODEOWNERS).
