# Core Goals

This section outlines the specific goals for this repository, with all responsibilities for a given goal falling to the designated [code owners](./CODEOWNERS) unless otherwise stated. In line with the first tenet of the code, direct any questions, concerns, or suggestions for modifications to them. While proposals for changes are welcome, please note that the goal owner(s) have the final say on the inclusion of any modifications.

Below is a prioritized list of the primary goals for this project, ranked by their importance:

## 1. Definitive Purpose

The primary aim of this repository is to distill core ethical principles that uphold individual dignity as paramount and guide the software development process effectively, grounded in the conviction that this strategy significantly enhances productivity and wellbeing. The effort is dedicated to rigorously, concisely, and unambiguously elucidating the principles that facilitate this dynamic and to vigilantly safeguarding against any breaches that might compromise it. These principles will be consolidated into a [single document](/CoE.md). Additional details will be relegated to [supplementary documents](#2-minimal-supplementation), ensuring that only essential information is included in the main "Code of Ethics".

   > **Note to Adopters:** We recommend that if you elect to modify the document for your specific project, limit the changes to no more than 10 tenets to maintain simplicity. The goal is to keep the Ethic focused on a manageable number of clear and actionable principles that all project participants can easily understand and agree upon.

## 2. Minimal Supplementation

   Provide optional supplementary documents that detail policies consistent with this code's spirit. These policy documents should adhere to the code's tenets and be as concise as possible. They should also be regularly reviewed to ensure strict compliance with the code.

   > **Note to Adopters:** You may modify these documents as needed. However, if you develop new policies or alter existing ones, ensure they align with the original Ethic to avoid compromising your enterprise's integrity.

## 3. Dogfooding

   Offer a canonical example that demonstrates how to implement this code and its underlying principles across this repository and its associated spaces. All supplementary documents should be regarded as effective.

## Markers of Success

1. **Adoption Rate and Feedback** —
   A high adoption rate of the ethical code among software development projects, accompanied by positive feedback regarding its clarity and relevance. Surveys or interviews could be conducted to assess satisfaction and the perceived impact on ethical practices.

2. **Enhanced Team Dynamics** —
   Reports of improved team dynamics and decision-making processes, as teams that adopt the ethical code demonstrate better alignment in values and increased mutual respect among members. This could be measured through team satisfaction surveys or peer reviews.

3. **Reduction in Ethical Breaches** —
   A measurable decrease in the number of ethical breaches or disputes within teams that have adopted the code. This could be tracked through internal audit reports or ethical monitoring systems.

4. **Impact on Wellbeing** —
   Evidence of enhanced wellbeing among team members, such as reduced stress levels, higher job satisfaction, and lower turnover rates. These outcomes can be measured through regular wellbeing assessments or hacker retention statistics.

5. **Influence on Industry Standards** —
   Recognition and integration of the ethical principles into broader industry standards or guidelines. Success in this area could be indicated by citations of the repository in industry white papers, guidelines, or standards documents.

6. **Scalability and Flexibility** —
   Demonstrated ability of the ethical code to scale across different sizes of projects and adapt to various technological domains without losing its effectiveness. Case studies or pilot projects could serve as evidence of scalability and flexibility.

7. **Continuous Improvement** —
   Establishment of a feedback loop where users can suggest improvements to the ethical code based on real-world experiences. Success is indicated by periodic updates that integrate this feedback, carefully ensuring that these changes do not compromise the code's original intent, thus keeping the code relevant and effective.

## Indicators for Improvement

1. **Low Adoption and Engagement** —
   A lower than expected adoption rate of the ethical code or lack of engagement from the target audience. This could indicate issues with accessibility, relevance, or awareness.

2. **Negative Feedback and Criticism** —
   Consistent, constructive criticism from users regarding the clarity, applicability, or impact of the ethical code. It's crucial to distinguish between general dissatisfaction and specific, actionable insights. Surveys, forums, and direct feedback are key sources of such qualified feedback.

3. **Reported Ethical Dilemmas and Conflicts** —
   An increase in reported ethical dilemmas or conflicts within teams that have adopted the code, suggesting that the principles may not be comprehensive or clear enough to guide decision-making effectively.

4. **Adverse Impact on Team Dynamics** —
   Observations or reports of worsened team dynamics, such as increased conflicts, misalignment of expectations, or decreased respect among members, indicating that the code may not be fostering the intended positive environment.

5. **Lack of Industry Recognition or Influence** —
   Minimal impact on broader industry standards, guidelines, or practices, suggesting that the ethical code may not be perceived as valuable or authoritative outside its immediate context.

6. **Challenges in Scalability or Flexibility** —
   Difficulty in applying the ethical code across various project sizes or technological domains, indicating a need for more adaptable or scalable guidelines.

7. **Stagnation and Lack of Updates** —
   A lack of updates or revisions to the ethical code over time, suggesting that it may not be evolving in response to new challenges, technologies, or feedback.

8. **Difficulty in Implementation** —
   Reports of challenges or obstacles in implementing the ethical code within real-world projects, indicating potential issues with practicality or comprehensiveness.

## Subsidiary Goals

### Enhance Clarity and Minimize Ambiguity

Strive to enhance clarity and minimize ambiguity in all project contexts, applying **Flexibility** and adhering to the other tenets. This goal directly supports the tenet of **Transparency** by ensuring that directions and intentions are clear, ensuring productive advancement towards our desired outcomes.

### Foster a Harmonious Environment

Proactively cultivate an environment that minimizes pressure and prevents conflicts. This approach upholds our commitment to **Professionalism**, ensuring productive and respectful interactions among all participants.

### Promote Continuous Learning and Improvement

Encourage continuous learning and iterative improvement within the project. This goal aligns with the tenet of **Flexibility**, fostering an environment where feedback is valued, and every contribution is seen as a step towards collective growth.

### Minimize Compulsion

Establish clear boundaries and expectations upfront to emphasize autonomy and self-directed advancement. Remediation is a last resort, used to reflect on and improve our processes. This strategy minimizes the need for enforced corrective actions while maximizing **Accountability** and **Transparency**, supporting a culture of mutual respect and proactive engagement.

### Encourage Explicit Buy-In

Advocating for explicit buy-in bolsters self-governance and aligns with our principles, naturally fostering **Flexibility**, seamless **Professionalism**, and inherent **Simplicity** as we scale. This approach simplifies adherence and makes shared agreement intuitive, reinforcing our core values efficiently.
