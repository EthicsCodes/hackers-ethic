# Introduction

This section outlines the specific goals for this repository, with all responsibilities falling to the designated [code owners](./CODEOWNERS) unless stated otherwise. In line with the first tenet of the code, direct any questions, concerns, or suggestions for modifications to them. While proposals for changes are welcome, please note that the goal owner(s) have the final say on the inclusion of any modifications. To avoid repeating the entire code, refer to the [Code of Ethics](/CoE.md) for further guidance.


## Ranked Goals

1. Guiding Purpose

   The primary aim of this repository is to distill core ethical principles which recognize the sovereignty of the individual and guide the software development process effectively. These principles will be consolidated into a [single document](/CoE.md). Additional details will be relegated to supplementary documents, ensuring that only essential information is included in the main "Code of Ethics".

2. Minimal Supplementation

   Provide optional supplementary documents that detail policies consistent with this code's spirit. These policy documents should adhere to the code's tenets and be as concise as possible. They should also be regularly reviewed to ensure strict compliance with the code.

   > **Note to Adopters:** You may modify these documents as needed. However, if you develop new policies or alter existing ones, ensure they align with the original Ethic to avoid compromising your enterprise's integrity.

3. Dogfooding

   Offer a canonical example that demonstrates how to implement this code and its underlying principles across this repository and its associated spaces. All supplementary documents should be regarded as effective.
