# Introduction

To maintain the conciseness and focus of our main [Code of Ethics](../CoE.md), this separate glossary provides authoritative definitions for key terms to enhance clarity and understanding within our project.

These definitions are intended to ensure consistent application and a shared understanding of crucial concepts. We encourage feedback and suggestions for revisions or additions to keep this resource relevant and up-to-date.

## Definitions

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Accountability</strong></dt>
  <dd>The responsibility of individuals to own their actions and decisions, including acknowledging mistakes or misjudgments, and addressing any consequences that affect the project or participants.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Analysis</strong></dt>
  <dd>The thorough examination of proposals and changes to ensure they meet the project’s standards for quality, relevance, and conciseness. Analysis is crucial for maintaining the integrity and effectiveness of the project’s outputs.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Autonomy</strong></dt>
  <dd>The freedom for individuals or groups to make decisions and take actions based on their own judgment and ethical guidelines, while remaining aligned with the project’s goals and Ethic.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Code Owner</strong></dt>
  <dd>Individuals or teams designated as the primary caretakers of specific sections of the project’s codebase. Code owners are responsible for maintaining the quality, integrity, and security of the code, and they have the authority to approve changes to their sections, ensuring consistency and adherence to the project’s standards.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Concise</strong></dt>
  <dd>The quality of expressing or explaining necessary information clearly and with as few words as possible, without omitting essential details. Conciseness helps in maintaining focus and efficiency in communications and documentation.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Consistency</strong></dt>
  <dd>The principle that ensures uniform behavior and treatment of similar features and processes across different implementations or platforms within the project. Consistency aims to provide a predictable and coherent user experience and operational environment, reducing confusion and enhancing usability. Intentional deviations from this uniformity must be justified and documented to maintain clarity and purpose.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Contributorship</strong></dt>
  <dd>A governance principle where leadership and decision-making authority are conferred based on demonstrated expertise, commitment, and active contribution to the project’s technical and operational goals. Contributorship ensures that those who lead are directly involved in and knowledgeable about the project’s work, actively preventing the Iron Law of Bureaucracy, where leadership becomes dominated by individuals more focused on maintaining their power than on the project's success. This principle promotes a leadership culture that is grounded in practical involvement and personal investment in the project’s outcomes.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Flexibility</strong></dt>
  <dd>The willingness and ability to adapt to new circumstances, challenges, or technologies, incorporating relevant ideas and approaches to enhance the project’s development and success.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Goal Owner</strong></dt>
  <dd>Individuals assigned the responsibility and authority over specific goals within the project. While they operate under the broader vision set by the project owner(s), goal owners have the autonomy to make decisions and direct efforts related to achieving their designated goals, making them the authoritative point of contact for those specific areas.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Integrity</strong></dt>
  <dd>Upholding moral and ethical principles in all actions related to the project, including honesty, transparency, and consistency in words and deeds.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Iron Law of Bureaucracy</strong></dt>
  <dd>A principle suggesting that in any bureaucratic organization, there are two kinds of people: those who work to further the actual goals of the organization, and those who work for the organization itself. The Iron Law states that in all cases, the second type of person will always gain control of the organization, and will always write the rules under which the organization functions. This takeover by bureaucracy often leads to the subversion or downfall of the original goals of the organization, as the focus shifts from achieving substantive outcomes to maintaining bureaucratic power and structure.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Leadership</strong></dt>
  <dd>The responsibility of guiding the project and its participants towards achieving its goals through exemplary conduct, clear direction, and accountability. Leadership involves not only taking responsibility for one’s own actions but also supporting and being accountable to their respective team. In situations where there is a vacuum of leadership, it is incumbent upon the most qualified or suitably skilled individual to assume the leadership role, explicitly when possible, to ensure continuity and stability in the project’s progression.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Moderation</strong></dt>
  <dd>The practice of guiding discussions to ensure they remain respectful, on-topic, and productive. Moderation involves facilitating dialogue in a manner that encourages constructive exchange of ideas, much like a moderator in a live debate who ensures that all participants have the opportunity to express their views within the agreed-upon framework of the discussion.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Pragmatism</strong></dt>
  <dd>Approaching problems and solutions based on practical considerations, focusing on effective outcomes and efficiency, while balancing idealistic goals with feasible implementations.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Professionalism</strong></dt>
  <dd>Conducting oneself with discipline and courtesy, treating all interactions within the project with seriousness and respect, and adhering to the ethical standards set forth.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Project Owner(s)</strong></dt>
  <dd>Individual(s) with the ultimate authority and responsibility for the overall direction and success of the project. Project owners set the vision, define the project’s goals, and ensure resources are allocated efficiently. While they delegate specific responsibilities, they retain the final decision-making power unless explicitly overridden as per defined project governance structures.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Purpose</strong></dt>
  <dd>The fundamental reason for the collective and individual participation in the project, defined by clearly delineated goals and leadership roles. Purpose guides all activities and decisions within the project, ensuring that every effort is directed towards realizing the project’s aims in a cohesive and structured manner.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Quality</strong></dt>
  <dd>The standard of something as measured against other similar things; a degree of excellence. In the context of the project, quality refers to the adherence to both functional and ethical standards, ensuring that outputs are not only effective but also responsibly crafted.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Reify</strong></dt>
  <dd>The process of turning abstract ideas or theories into tangible, practical outcomes that clearly demonstrate the value and applicability of those ideas within the project.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Relevant</strong></dt>
  <dd>Pertaining directly to the matter at hand. Relevance ensures that contributions, discussions, and decisions are focused on advancing the project’s goals and addressing current needs or challenges.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Remediation</strong></dt>
  <dd>The process of addressing and resolving instances where individuals fail to comply with the projects’s ethical standards or rules. Remediation focuses on corrective actions that aim to limit damage and restore the integrity of the project environment. This may involve discussions with the involved parties, implementing consequences as outlined in the supplementary guidelines, or suggesting additional resources to prevent future occurrences.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Respect</strong></dt>
  <dd>Acknowledging the value and contributions of others, engaging in communication and actions that reflect consideration and esteem for all participants, regardless of differing views or backgrounds.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Simplicity</strong></dt>
  <dd>The commitment to clarity and ease of understanding in all project-related activities, while carefully avoiding oversimplification that could compromise effectiveness. Simplicity involves striking the ideal balance between sufficient detail and accessibility, ensuring efficacy, maintainability, and cohesion for all participants.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Subsidiarity</strong></dt>
  <dd>A governance principle advocating for delegating decision-making authority to the most local or immediate level that is competent to handle those decisions. In the context of the project, subsidiarity ensures that responsibility is placed as close to the relevant context as possible, enhancing flexibility, relevance, and responsiveness. This principle supports a clear hierarchical structure for escalating concerns or decisions that exceed the local scope, ensuring coherence and unity in achieving the project’s objectives.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Team Leaders</strong></dt>
  <dd>Individuals who lead specific teams within the project, guiding day-to-day operations and tactical execution towards the project’s goals. Team leaders are responsible for coordinating their members, fostering collaboration, and ensuring their team’s contributions align with the project’s overall direction and ethics.</dd>
  <dt><strong>Transparency</strong></dt>
  <dd>The practice of openly sharing information related to decision-making processes, project developments, and operational methods, ensuring that actions are understandable and traceable by all stakeholders.</dd>
