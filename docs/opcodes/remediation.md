## Remediation

Violations, misapplications, or misappropriations of the [Code of Ethics](../../CoE.md) will incur proportionate measures aimed at restoring and maintaining the [etiquette](../etiquette.md) of both the individual and the project. These measures will be clearly defined to ensure accountability and allow for independent verification of compliance with the code. Additionally, all remedial decisions are open to [appeal](./appeals.md).

### Recommended Escalation Procedure

Remediation is primarily the responsibility of the designated [project owner(s)](../CODEOWNERS) or team leader(s) (hereafter referred to as admins). In line with the tenet of transparency, these roles should be well-documented. We recommend adhering to the principle of [subsidiarity](/docs/etiquette.md#subsidiarity-divide-and-conquer) to ensure issues are handled effectively and promptly, facilitating a structured escalation process. Before escalating to remediation at all, we recommend formal or informal [moderation](../etiquette.md#moderation-remediation) based on your project's specific procedures.

Acknowledging our inherent capacity to err, we advise caution when considering remedial actions. This guideline illustrates a progressively severe approach to handling perceived violations of our ethical tenets. We encourage local team members to engage in each step, although only designated admins have the authority to take formal action. However, team members should promptly bring issues to the attention of admins. Be mindful of not misusing the complaint system and ensure that your concerns are clear, concise, and adhere to these guidelines to avoid violating tenets.

1. **Initial Moderation**: Aim to steer the conversation back on course and maintain a respectful and professional tone. Avoid using threatening or authoritative language at this stage and keep the interaction informal.
2. **Reinforcing Tenets**: Continue to emphasize the importance of adhering to the tenets, possibly by linking to the [CoE](/CoE.md) and explaining how the current conduct may violate specific tenets.
3. **Temporary Mute**: If necessary, respectfully inform that a brief mute (not exceeding 1 hour at the admin's discretion) has been requested or enacted to allow time for reflection.
4. **Extended Mute**: Should problematic behavior persist post-mute, or if a mute request is ignored, inform that a longer mute has been requested or enacted. Issue a stern warning that further infractions could lead to a temporary ban. Mutes in this stage should not exceed 1 day except in extreme circumstances.
5. **Temporary Ban**: If extended mutes are ineffective, or if the situation escalates rapidly, admins may, at their discretion, issue a temporary ban. Before taking this step, advise that immediate cessation of the problematic conduct is necessary to avoid a ban. Temporary bans should not exceed 2 weeks except in extreme circumstances.
6. **Extended Ban**: Recognizing that individuals can change, permanent bans should be rare and reserved for the most severe cases. An excessive number of permanent bans may indicate a failure in leadership and could significantly erode trust within the project. If an extended ban is deemed necessary, it should last between 3-6 months to a year, depending on the severity of the case, allowing sufficient time for reflection and change.

#### Note to Those Affected

If you intend to appeal a remediation decision, please engage with the appeal process to articulate your case. Misuse of the appeal process is strongly discouraged and could adversely affect your case. For the best chance of success, ensure that your appeal is made in good faith, aligning with our Ethic and specifically upholding the tenets of professionalism and accountability.

If you are firmly convinced that your case or initial appeal was mishandled and can present a strong case, you are allowed to escalate the matter up the chain, proceeding stepwise, such as from a team lead to a project owner. However, once you have followed the escalation procedures, it is crucial to respect the final decision.

#### Note to Admins, _et al._

Admins are expected to make difficult judgment calls while maintaining professionalism and impartiality. This process should build trust and demonstrate commitment to the project's welfare over personal interests. Maintain privacy and dignity by discussing potential remedial actions privately with the involved parties and using moderation techniques in public forums without exerting undue authority. Remember, any remedial action carries the potential risk of eroding trust and cohesion. Such actions should be carefully considered and avoided wherever possible to preserve the integrity and unity of the team.
